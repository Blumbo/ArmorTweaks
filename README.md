# Armor Tweaks server mod
This is a mod for combat snapshot 8c which tweaks different combat mechanics, including some parts from the Armor Tweaks mod.
### List of everything different from combat snapshot 8c:  
- Swords do the same amount of damage as in 1.16
- Axes do 1 more damage than swords
- Pickaxes do 1 less damage than swords
- Shovels do 1 less damage than pickaxes
- Tridents do 8 damage instead of 7
- Impaling has been nerfed: First enchantment level gives +2 damage in water, each next enchantment gives +1
- Enchantment calculations use the (15/(15+x)) formula instead of (1-x/25) where x is enchantment protection
- Enchantment protection is no longer capped at 20
- Explosions do 0.5625 times the damage as in 1.16 (as a balance for nerfed protection)
